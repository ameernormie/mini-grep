# Building a Command Line Program

> Rust’s speed, safety, single binary output, and cross-platform support make it an ideal language for creating command line tools, so for this project, we’ll make our own version of the classic command line tool `grep` (globally search a regular expression and print). In the simplest use case, grep searches a specified file for a specified string. To do so, grep takes as its arguments a filename and a string. Then it reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lines.

### Concepts that will be covered

- Organizing code
- Using vectors and strings
- Handling errors
- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate
- Writing tests
